# Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders

- Please find the email.pdf in this directory, which contains a draft of the email outlining how I plan to approach the stakeholders to discuss the following questions:

1. What questions do you have about the data?
2. How did you discover the data quality issues?
3. What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
4. What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
5. What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
